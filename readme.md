# My cheat sheet for go concurrent programming 

## THE PIPELINE 
Pipeline has three stages
1. First one, getting data from *inbound* channels (producer stage) (this is data_source.go)
2. Second one, perform some processing on that data (this is process_data.go)
3. Third one, sending data to *outbound* channels (consumer stage) (this is write_to_file.go)
